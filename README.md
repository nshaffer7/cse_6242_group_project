## Development
1. Clone this repo locally
2. (optional) Setup gitignore: Run `cp .gitignore.sample .gitignore`
3. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) if you don't have it
4. Install dependencies: Run `poetry install`, which will create a virtualenv for you and install the dependencies
5. Instantiate virtualenv: Run `poetry shell` or point your IDE of choice to the poetry virtualenv

> I strongly recommend using Poetry, but I also created a snapshot (4/19/22) of the requirements in requirements.txt but be aware I may not be great at keeping it up to date.
